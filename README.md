# Check list

- Should pass by reference
- Empty input
- Check variable by variable to see if anything is forgotten.
- What if only contains 1 element
- Initialize vector length
- Can we use hash map to create a “reverse” mapping
Consider tree traversal in unusual order
- Whether .empty() has be reversed
- Check if there are predicate branches not handled
- For array problems, check if 0 elements can be handled.
- Check if pop() is always on non-empty containers.
- Be careful whether it is binary tree or binary search tree
- Easy to forgot changing the iterator in while loops
- Easy to get confused which container to use. E.g. while (!c.empty())
- Don't forgot to advance pointer in linked list questions.
